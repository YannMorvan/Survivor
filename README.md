## Survivor Pool

**IMPROVISE. ADAPT. OVERCOME.**

### Overview

Welcome to **Survivor Pool**, an innovative project developed in collaboration with Soul Connection, a leading coaching agency. This project aims to deliver a comprehensive dashboard designed to streamline the workflow of Soul Connectionâ€™s coaches and standardize client management processes.

### Project Context

Soul Connection is evolving to enhance client information management and coach interactions. The current fragmented system involves diverse methods for tracking and managing client data. **Survivor Pool** seeks to unify this process by creating a user-friendly dashboard that integrates with an existing, well-documented API, enabling seamless CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on client data.

### Project Requirements

The task is to develop both the frontend and backend components of the application. The provided API will serve as a source of data that we need to fetch, store in our backend, and make fully modifiable within the system. 

## Getting Started

To begin with **Survivor Pool**, ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system. For detailed setup instructions, refer to our [Wiki](https://github.com/YannMorvan/Survivor/wiki) to get both backend and frontend services up and running efficiently.
